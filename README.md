masterpassword
==============

This is a [MasterPassword](http://masterpasswordapp.com/) implementation in Go.

There is a library and a small command line tool; both in early development stages but usable.

Installation
------------

Installing the library works the usual way:

    go get github.com/deniswernert/masterpassword

Installing the commmand line tool is equally simple:

    go install github.com/deniswernert/masterpassword/masterpassword
